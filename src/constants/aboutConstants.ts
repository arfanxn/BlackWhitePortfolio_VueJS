<p>
A backend developer and Web3 enthusiast, I began my coding journey in 2021, during my second year of high school, where I dedicated 6 to 8 hours each day to learning programming by self-teaching. I explored various fields like frontend, mobile, backend, AI, DevOps, and Web3. After completing several projects, I realized that backend development and Web3 are where my true passion lies, and I’ve been focusing on these ever since.

In addition to coding, I’m passionate about philosophy, psychology, and economics, which shape how I approach problem-solving. Communication science is a recent interest, particularly its role in financial markets and crypto investments. Outside of tech, I’m a cat lover and enjoy model photography, both as a photographer and a model.

I’m always eager to learn and grow, whether it's in technology or other areas that spark my curiosity.
