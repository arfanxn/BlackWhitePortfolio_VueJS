<p>
I started my coding journey in 2021 during my second year of high school, dedicating 6 to 8 hours a day to learning programming. I explored various fields like frontend, mobile development, backend, AI, DevOps, and Web3. After completing several projects, I realized that backend development and Web3 are where my true passion lies, and I’ve been focusing on these ever since.

<p>
In addition to coding, I’m passionate about philosophy, psychology, and economics, which shape how I approach problem-solving. Communication science is a recent interest, particularly its role in financial markets and crypto investments. Outside of tech, I’m a cat lover and enjoy model photography, both as a photographer and a model. You can check out my work on Instagram: @arfanxn.

I’m always eager to learn and grow, whether it's in technology or other areas that spark my curiosity.
